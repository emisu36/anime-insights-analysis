# 🎌 Anime Recommendation System Analysis  
*A Group Project for QST BA 780: Introduction to Data Analytics @ Boston University Questrom School of Business*

---

## 🧠 Overview  
This project explores user demographics and viewing behavior on **MyAnimeList**, aiming to identify key factors that influence anime preferences and guide the design of a data-driven recommendation system — all **without using ML models**.  

We merged three large datasets (24 M + rows) into a unified analytical table, cleaned and optimized in Python using Pandas and PyArrow.  
Through exploratory data analysis and visualization, we uncovered who the viewers are, what they watch, and how platforms can better recommend content.
